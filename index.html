            <p>Hello. My name is Diego Arizpe, I am a UX/UI Designer from Atlanta, Ga; I went to school for Graphic Design but life hit me so
                I wasnt able to graduate, I've been managing restaurants ever since but my passion has always been art, I took up photography about 4 years ago as a 
                hobby and it has taken me places i didnt think i'd ever see, about 2 years ago I took a Web Application Development course and came to the conclusion
                that coding wasnt at all for me, it was because of that course that i discovered what UX/UI was and so after doing research felt that this 
                was the career path for me so with that said I started my journey with UX/UI 6 months ago and havent looked back.</p>
